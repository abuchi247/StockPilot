# Inventzo — Inventory & Sales ERP

A comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning system for product-based businesses — inventory, sales, purchasing, and reporting in one place. Built with Python FastAPI, Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

> Inventzo currently ships with an automotive spare-parts catalogue out of the box. The core (inventory, sales, customers, suppliers, purchasing, transfers, auditing) is business-agnostic and is being generalized to support additional business types.

## Overview

Inventzo digitizes and streamlines operations for product-based businesses, replacing manual spreadsheet and paper-based processes with a modern, scalable ERP solution featuring immutable ledger architecture, FIFO cost management, and snapshot-based auditing.

## Key Capabilities

- **Inventory Management** — Multi-location stock tracking with FIFO cost layers and barcode support
- **Sales Management** — Cash and credit sales with pessimistic locking, automatic COGS calculation, partial payments at checkout, and PDF invoice generation
- **Customer Management** — Credit ledger with limit enforcement, aging analysis, payment tracking linked to specific sales, and partial payment support
- **Supplier Management** — Purchase orders with full lifecycle (draft → approved → received), goods receipt notes, and supplier balance tracking
- **Transfer Management** — Multi-location transfers with in-transit state and cost layer propagation
- **Barcode System** — Code 128 barcode generation, scanning, and lookup
- **Inventory Audits** — Snapshot-based cycle counts and full stock counts with variance tracking
- **Invoice Generation** — PDF invoices in A4 and thermal (80mm) formats with QR codes and barcodes. Supports regeneration to reflect updated business settings. Credit notes generated automatically for returns.
- **Business Settings** — Configurable company profile (name, logo, address, bank details) that populates invoices and reports
- **Reporting & Dashboard** — Sales, inventory, customer, supplier, and financial reports with CSV/PDF export. Dashboard with Top 5 Products and Top 5 Customers widgets filterable by period (month, 3M, 6M, 1Y, all time).
- **Notifications** — Low stock alerts, credit limit warnings, overdue customer reminders, and pending approval notifications
- **Audit Trail** — Append-only, immutable record of all critical system events
- **Security** — Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Salesperson, Storekeeper) with JWT authentication, rate limiting, sliding-window account lockout (locks after 5 failed logins within 15 minutes for 30 minutes), admin-initiated password reset for users who forget theirs, and forced password change on first login

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abuchi247/StockPilot.git
   cd StockPilot
   ```

2. **Create environment file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and set your `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `SECRET_KEY` values.

3. **Start all services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This builds and starts all five containers: PostgreSQL, Redis, the FastAPI backend, the ARQ background worker, and the Next.js frontend. The frontend is built inside Docker using the production standalone build — no local Node.js installation required.

4. **Database migrations** run automatically inside the backend container before Uvicorn accepts traffic. To re-run them manually (e.g. after adding migrations):
   ```bash
   docker exec stockpilot-backend alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Retrieve the initial admin password**. On a fresh database (no users), the backend auto-creates an `admin` account with a random temporary password and prints it to the container logs exactly once:
   ```bash
   docker logs stockpilot-backend 2>&1 | grep "Temporary Password"
   ```
   You will see output like:
   ```
     Temporary Password: xK7#mPq2RvLnJ9Ys
   ```
   This password is generated uniquely for each deployment and is never stored in plaintext.

6. **Log in and set your password**. Open http://localhost:3000 and log in with username `admin` and the temporary password from the logs. You will be redirected to a "Set your password" screen where you must choose a new password before accessing the system.

7. **Seed default categories** (optional)
   ```bash
   docker exec stockpilot-backend python scripts/seed_categories.py
   ```
   This creates 10 parent categories (Brakes, Filters, Engine Parts, etc.) with 35 subcategories.

8. **Access the application**

   | Service | URL |
   |---------|-----|
   | Frontend (UI) | http://localhost:3000 |
   | Backend API | http://localhost:8000 |
   | Health check | http://localhost:8000/health |
   | API Docs (Swagger) | http://localhost:8000/docs |

9. **Get your admin password.** On a fresh database the backend auto-creates an `admin` account and prints the temporary password to the container logs exactly once:
   ```bash
   docker logs stockpilot-backend 2>&1 | grep "Temporary Password"
   ```
   Log in at http://localhost:3000 with username `admin` and that password. You will be prompted to set a new password before accessing the system.

10. **Restart from scratch** (wipes all data and rebuilds the images):
    ```bash
    docker compose down -v          # stops containers and deletes all volumes
    docker compose up --build -d    # rebuilds images and starts fresh
    docker logs stockpilot-backend 2>&1 | grep "Temporary Password"  # get new password
    ```

> **Local development with hot-reload:** if you want live code reloading on the frontend, stop the frontend container (`docker compose stop frontend`) and run `npm run dev` in the `frontend/` directory instead. The backend services stay in Docker.

### Database backups

Run an on-demand backup at any time (results go to `./backups/` on the host):

```bash
docker-compose run --rm --profile backup backup
```

Label it before a release to make it easy to find later:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm --profile backup -e BACKUP_LABEL=pre-release backup
```

In production, `docker-compose.production.yml` includes a scheduled backup service that runs automatically every day at 02:00 UTC. See [OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md §4](OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md#4-backup-and-restore) for restore instructions, off-site storage, and restore verification.

### Initial Admin Provisioning

The system follows security best practices for initial credentials:

- **No hardcoded passwords** — the initial admin password is a cryptographically random 16-character string generated at first startup.
- **Displayed once** — the password appears in the backend container logs only on the first boot when the users table is empty. It is not shown on subsequent restarts.
- **Forced password change** — the auto-provisioned admin (and all admin-created users) must change their password on first login before accessing any part of the system.
- **Scoped token** — during the password change flow, a short-lived token (10-minute TTL) restricts the user to only the password change endpoint until they set their own credentials.

If you need to create additional users via CLI, they also require a password change on first login by default:

```bash
docker exec stockpilot-backend python scripts/create_user.py \
  --username manager --password TempPass1! --role Manager --email manager@example.com
```

To skip the forced password change (e.g., for automated testing), add `--no-force-change`:

```bash
docker exec stockpilot-backend python scripts/create_user.py \
  --username testuser --password TestPass1! --role Salesperson --email test@example.com --no-force-change
```

### Production operations

Production deployments must replace every development placeholder, inject credentials through a secret manager, and run the serialized Alembic migration step before enabling traffic. The complete procedure covers required environment variables, secret generation, backups and restore drills, `/health` readiness checks, ARQ worker operation, error tracking, rollback, supported frontend versions, and dependency upgrades:

- [Production Operations Runbook](OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md)

The Compose defaults are for local development only. Never commit a populated `.env` file. The initial admin password is unique per deployment and must be changed on first login.

### Default User Roles

|------|--------|
| Admin | Full system access including user management |
| Manager | Approvals, reports, operational oversight |
| Salesperson | Sales processing, customer lookup, invoices |

### Notification Routing by Role

Notifications are automatically generated and delivered to specific roles based on the event type:

| Notification Type | Target Roles | Trigger |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| Low Stock Alert | Storekeeper, Manager, Admin | Stock falls below minimum level |
| Credit Limit Exceeded | Manager, Admin | Customer balance exceeds credit limit |
| Overdue Customer | Manager, Admin | Customer balance outstanding 90+ days |
| Pending Approval Reminder | Manager, Admin | Transfer or PO pending approval > 24 hours |

Each user sees only their own notifications. Notifications support read/unread status and can be marked individually or in bulk.

## Creating Users

This is an internal ERP system — there's no public signup. Admins create user accounts via the Settings page or the CLI script. All newly created users must change their password on first login.

### Using the CLI script

```bash
# Create an admin (will be required to set own password on first login)
docker exec stockpilot-backend python scripts/create_user.py \
  --username admin --password TempAdmin1! --role Admin --email admin@example.com

# Create a manager
docker exec stockpilot-backend python scripts/create_user.py \
  -u manager -p TempMgr1! -r Manager -e manager@example.com

# Create a salesperson
docker exec stockpilot-backend python scripts/create_user.py \
  -u sales1 -p TempSales1! -r Salesperson -e sales@example.com

# Create a storekeeper
docker exec stockpilot-backend python scripts/create_user.py \
  -u store1 -p TempStore1! -r Storekeeper -e store@example.com

# Skip forced password change (for testing/automation only)
docker exec stockpilot-backend python scripts/create_user.py \
  -u testuser -p TestPass1! -r Salesperson -e test@example.com --no-force-change
```

**Password requirements:** minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.

**Available roles:** `Admin`, `Manager`, `Salesperson`, `Storekeeper`

**First login behavior:** By default, all CLI-created users must change their password on first login. The temporary password provided in the `--password` flag is only used for the initial authentication — the user immediately sets their own password. Use `--no-force-change` to skip this requirement (not recommended for production).

## Deployment

Inventzo deploys as a self-contained Docker Compose stack (backend API, ARQ worker, frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis) behind a Caddy reverse proxy that terminates HTTPS automatically. The recommended host is a small VPS in a **Johannesburg** region, which gives the lowest latency for West-African (e.g. Nigerian) users while keeping cost around $6–12/month.

**Full step-by-step instructions — server setup, Caddy HTTPS, DNS, data migration off Railway, and Railway shutdown — are in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).**

Quick summary:

1. Provision a small VPS in a Johannesburg region and point your domain's DNS at its IP.
2. Install Docker + the Compose plugin, clone this repo, and create a production `.env` (see `.env.example`).
3. Bring up the stack with `docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d --build` behind Caddy for automatic TLS.
4. Migrations run automatically on backend startup (`backend/start.sh` runs `alembic upgrade head`, then launches uvicorn with `WEB_CONCURRENCY` workers). Grab the initial admin's temporary password from the backend logs (search for `Temporary Password`).

> **Why not a free PaaS tier:** free tiers sleep after inactivity (~30s cold starts) and often place servers far from West Africa, both of which hurt the user experience for the target market. A small always-on VPS close to your users is faster and more predictable for a real business.

## First-Time Configuration

After initial setup, an Admin should configure the business profile so that invoices display the correct company information.

1. Log in as Admin
2. Go to **Settings** → **Business Profile**
3. Fill in:
   - Business name
   - Phone, email, address
   - Tax ID
   - Upload a business logo (PNG/JPEG, max 500KB — resized automatically for invoices)
   - Bank details (shown on invoices for payment instructions)
   - Invoice footer text
4. Click **Save Business Settings**

This information appears on all generated invoices. To update it later, change the settings and click **Regenerate** on any existing invoice to re-render it with the new details.

## Frontend end-to-end tests

The Playwright suite covers browser login and creation/cancellation of an isolated draft sale. It creates a unique location, spare part, and stock adjustment through the authenticated API, then removes the fixture records after the test; it does not use shared production data.

Create a dedicated test user first (bypassing the forced password change so Playwright can log in directly):

```bash
docker exec stockpilot-backend python scripts/create_user.py \
  -u testuser -p TestPass1! -r Salesperson -e test@example.com --no-force-change
```

Then install dependencies and run the suite:

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm run build
E2E_USERNAME=testuser E2E_PASSWORD='TestPass1!' npm run e2e
```

The API must be available at `E2E_API_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1`) and the frontend at `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:3000`). Set `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_WEBSERVER=true` when an already-running frontend should be reused. CI supplies `E2E_USERNAME` and `E2E_PASSWORD` through encrypted repository secrets and starts disposable PostgreSQL, Redis, and backend services before running the suite. The CI workflow is `.github/workflows/frontend-e2e.yml`.
