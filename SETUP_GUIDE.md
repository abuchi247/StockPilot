# Invenzo — Setup & Operations Guide (SOP)

A step-by-step guide for business owners setting up the system for the first time. Follow each phase in order.

---

## Phase 1: Start the System

```bash
cd /Users/abuchiobiegbu/Desktop/StockPilot
docker compose up --build -d
```

Wait 30 seconds, then get your admin password:

```bash
docker logs stockpilot-backend 2>&1 | grep "Temporary Password"
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and log in:
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** (from the logs above)
- You'll be asked to set a new password — choose something strong (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit)

---

## Phase 2: Configure Your Business Profile (Admin)

**Where:** Settings → Business Profile tab

Do this FIRST — it controls what appears on every invoice.

| Field | What to enter | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Business Name | Your registered business name | Chidi Auto Parts Ltd |
| Email | Business email | info@chidiautoparts.com |
| Tax ID | TIN or VAT number | TIN-12345678 |
| Website | (optional) | www.chidiautoparts.com |
| Address | Full physical address | 15 Broad Street, Lagos Island, Lagos |
| Phone Numbers | Click "Add phone number" for each | Main: 08012345678, WhatsApp: 09087654321 |
| Bank Accounts | Click "Add bank account" for each | First Bank / 0123456789 / Chidi Auto Parts Ltd |
| Logo | Upload PNG or JPEG (max 500KB) | Your company logo |
| Invoice Footer | Payment terms or thank-you note | "Thank you for your patronage. Net 30 days." |

Click **Save Business Settings** when done.

---

## Phase 3: Create Locations (Admin)

**Where:** Locations → Add Location

You need at least ONE location before you can add stock. Create one per physical place you store/sell parts.

| Location Name | Type | Purpose |
|---------------|------|---------|
| Main Warehouse | Warehouse | Where bulk stock is stored |
| Ikeja Shop | Shop | Retail outlet where customers buy |
| Abuja Branch | Shop | Second retail outlet (if you have one) |

---

## Phase 4: Review Categories (Already Done Automatically)

**Where:** Categories

The system auto-creates 10 parent categories with 35 subcategories on first startup:

- Brakes (Brake Pads, Brake Discs, Brake Fluid)
- Filters (Oil Filters, Air Filters, Fuel Filters, Cabin Filters)
- Engine Parts (Pistons, Gaskets, Timing Belts, Spark Plugs)
- Electrical (Batteries, Alternators, Starters, Sensors)
- Suspension (Shock Absorbers, Springs, Control Arms)
- Body Parts (Bumpers, Fenders, Mirrors, Lights)
- Transmission (Clutch, Gearbox, CV Joints)
- Cooling (Radiators, Water Pumps, Thermostats, Hoses)
- Exhaust (Mufflers, Catalytic Converters, Exhaust Pipes)
- Fuel System (Fuel Pumps, Injectors, Fuel Lines)

Add any custom categories your business needs that aren't covered.

---

## Phase 5: Add Your First Spare Parts (Admin or Storekeeper)

**Where:** Inventory → Add Part

Add 3–5 parts to test with:

| Field | Example Part 1 | Example Part 2 |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Part Number | (auto-generated) | (auto-generated) |
| Name | Front Brake Pad Set | Oil Filter |
| Brand | Bosch | Mann |
| Category | Brakes → Brake Pads | Filters → Oil Filters |
| Unit of Measure | Set | PCS |
| Cost Price | 5000 | 1500 |
| Selling Price | 8500 | 3000 |
| Min Stock Level | 10 | 20 |
| Initial Stock Location | Main Warehouse | Main Warehouse |
| Initial Stock Quantity | 50 | 100 |

**Important:** Selling price must be ≥ cost price (the system enforces this).

---

## Phase 6: Create Staff Accounts (Admin)

**Where:** Settings → User Management → Create User

Create one account per role to test with:

| Username | Role | What they can do |
|----------|------|------------------|

| `sales1` | Salesperson | Create sales, manage customers, record payments, generate invoices |

## Resetting Everything (Start Fresh)

If you need to start over completely:

```bash
docker compose down -v          # Deletes all data
docker compose up --build -d    # Rebuilds and starts fresh
docker logs stockpilot-backend 2>&1 | grep "Temporary Password"
```

This gives you a clean database with only the admin account and default categories.
