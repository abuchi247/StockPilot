"""Backfill credit ledger entries for confirmed credit sales that are missing them.

This script finds all confirmed credit sales that don't have a corresponding
credit ledger entry and creates them. Safe to run multiple times (idempotent).

Usage:
    # Local Docker:
    docker exec invenzo-backend python scripts/backfill_credit_ledger.py

    # Railway:
    cd backend && railway run python3 scripts/backfill_credit_ledger.py
